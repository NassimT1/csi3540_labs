## How the game works
The game contains 5 dice, 2 buttons (Roll Dice and Start Over), and a scoreboard. The user starts by clicking on the roll dice button to roll the dice. If the user wants to keep a die, they can select it and it becomes red. If the user is satisfied with a score (which updates dynamically), they can click on the score that they want. Once a score has been selected, it becomes bold. This process will be repeated until the user has clicked every possible score. Once there are no more possible scores to click on, a game over pop up will appear with the final score and the option to start over by clicking a button.
